# Playground Series S4E10

Welcome to the Playground Series S4E10 repository! This repository contains data and resources for the Kaggle competition focused on predicting loan approval status.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Loan Approval Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences and to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

## 📂 Files

- **train.csv**: The training dataset; `loan_status` is the binary target.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of the target `loan_status` for each row.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the correct format.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
